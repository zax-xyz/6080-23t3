# Week 10

Last week of the term! Hopefully assignment 4 is going well...

## Testing

This is worth 15% in your assignment but it's an easy 15%! You shouldn't need anything more complicated than what's shown in these exercises (aside from the UI test needing to be longer, but the spec tells you exactly what you need to do)

Note that a "happy path" should be testing something happens _successfully_ (hence the name) - that is, don't test invalid inputs etc

Really good [forum post from Hayden](https://edstem.org/au/courses/13869/discussion/1706077) if you missed it

## Exam

Jumpscare! The exam is on the 24th and will be online. More info to be explained in the tut

Darian (one of the other tutors) made a really small [practice exam](https://github.com/Darianlmj/COMP6080-23T1/tree/main/tut10) a while ago (with solutions!) that should reflect the general structure of the exam. Hayden should release a bigger sample exam soon‚Ñ¢ that (should) mimics the size of the actual exam

    Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

    - perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
    - contribute to the Web

    Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

    - auditory
    - cognitive
    - neurological
    - physical
    - speech
    - visual

    Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

    - people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
    - older people with changing abilities due to ageing
    - people with "temporary disabilities" such as a broken arm or lost glasses
    - people with "situational limitations" such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio
    - people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth

## What is accessibility ❓❓

### Lecture definition

Everyone has different preferences for how they live their life and accessibility is about accommodating everyone.

### [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility)

Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments so as to be usable by people with disabilities.

Or, from the article on [web accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility):

Web accessibility, or eAccessibility, is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, more users have equal access to information and functionality.

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

- perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
- contribute to the Web

Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

- auditory
- cognitive
- neurological
- physical
- speech
- visual

Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

- people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
- older people with changing abilities due to ageing
- people with "temporary disabilities" such as a broken arm or lost glasses
- people with "situational limitations" such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio
- people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth
